# AdventOfCode

My code for the https://adventofcode.com/ challenge



* year 2019 and 2020 are in python
* year 2021 in java


## Notes
Not every folder is an actuall solution because I use a batch script to create a year <br>
better solution for that can be found in my friends repo: [Koen's AdventOfCode](https://github.com/UnderKoen/AdventOfCode)
which I intend to implement in some way or other.

He is also making a [plugin](https://github.com/UnderKoen/AdventOfCodePlugin)!!
