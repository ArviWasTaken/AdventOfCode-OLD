# AdventOfCode

My code for the https://adventofcode.com/ challenge



* year 2019 and 2020 are in python
* year 2021 and 2023 are in java


## Notes
Not every folder is an actual solution in year 2019 and 2020 because I use a batch script to create an entire year at once.<br>
A better solution for that can be found in my friends repo: [Koen's AdventOfCode](https://github.com/UnderKoen/AdventOfCode)
which I intend to implement in some way or other.

He is also making a [plugin](https://github.com/UnderKoen/AdventOfCodePlugin)!!
